# IterativeSearch

Files list writer  - Iterative research 

Simple C++ software, based on Boost 1.67 framework, to perform an iterative research of all the files included in a certain path.
Software will scan all directories and sub-directories included in a certain path and create a file list (.txt) with all the files' absolute paths.

No any filter has been added to the found files !

    argv[1] -> INPUT_PATH (path of the directory to search for
    argv[2] -> OUT_LIST_PATH (output path of the file list produced)

Enjoy using ;-)
